# Mockup for front-end of CodeDay homepage

* Built with [Harp](http://harpjs.com)

## To test out and develop on local machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:krrishd/codeday-mockup.git
$ cd codeday-mockup/
$ harp server _root
```
All the data, Jade files, and LESS files that power the site are in the ```_root``` folder. Changing the HTML/CSS in the main folder will not chanage anything, and all changes will be written over.
